# Music Player

A simple music player app.

* Built for API 15 or higher
* 2 activities: MainActivity and NowPlayingActivity

## Basic structure:

MainActivity displays a ListView of songs (contained in an ArrayList, along with album and artist). The user can click on a ListView item, which sends the data to the NowPlayingActivity using an explicit intent.
